AutoSA Examples
===============

This page covers a list of design exmaples to get you familiar with the AutoSA 
compilation process. Examples are divided into two categories: 

* Small Designs: These designs are limited in the problem size so that you could 
  easily verify and synthesize the design within hours.
* Large Designs: These designs are used for demonstrating the performance of AutoSA-generated
  designs, and it may take more than days for verification and synthesis flow.
